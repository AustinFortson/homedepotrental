# Home Depot Rental App (concept)


Recognized Home Depotâ€™s current issue of only allowing
customers to secure a tool for rental in store as opposed to
giving customers an option to do so online as well and created
an E-commerce solution . By creating a website capable of
making rental purchases online customers will no longer have
to rush and worry about if a tool will be in store by the time they
need it.
